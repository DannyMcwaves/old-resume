                | Dear Hiring Manager:
            div.col-xs-10.col-xs-offset-1.p-t-1
                div.p-b-1
                    | I am a computer programmer and web developer writing with regards to the job
                    | advertisement
                    | on
                    | your website
                    | for a Full stack developer.
                    | Given my related
                    | experience and excellent capabilities that matches your search for an awesome person with
                    | visual intelligence and a user experience centric mindset who shares the same passion as your team,
                    | I would really appreciate your consideration for this job opening.

                div.p-b-1
                    | The nature of my education, I believe has prepared me for this job. It involved a great
                    | deal of research, self study, self motivation and a wide range of skills as well as
                    | projects to assert them.
                    |  First, I have had a programming experience with both Front-End and Back-End JavaScript as well as all
                    | front-end
                    | technologies like CSS3, HTML5, LESS and some frameworks such as bootstrap, jQuery and Angular.
                    | I have good programmatic
                    | understanding of relational databases, both SQL and no-SQL. Mobile first and dynamic designs are second
                    | nature to me.
                    | I have successfully deployed some projects online which includes my portfolio,
                    | https://dannymcwaves.herokuapp.com and a codebase, https://mycodebase.herokuapp.com.
                    | All of which are RESTive. I am good with debugging and
                    | the use of linters for code testing. Furthermore, I have a very deep understanding of python as it was my
                    | first  language. You can check my github at https://github.com/DannyMcwaves

                div.p-b-1
                    | Also, my experience with computers from a very tender age enabled me to work as
                    | an IT tutor in my former school at the age of 18. I worked harmoniously with some of my
                    | former teachers. This was possible due to mutual understanding, effective, coherent
                    | and respectful communication as well as dedicated and shared team work,
                    | which I believe are strong values embedded in your team and a major requirement of
                    | every employee.

                div.p-b-1
                    | Moreover, what I really love about TalentAdore is that, it will give me the opportunity to learn
                    | more whilst using the skills I have harnessed. Also, it has a relaxed working environment and
                    | remote options, an opportunity I have always dreaded.

                    | To further acquaint you with my background, I am attaching a resume. I welcome the
                    | opportunity to speak with you about my qualifications and ways I can contribute to
                    | TalentAdore.
                    | I can best be reached through email, dannymcwaves96@gmail.com, and phone, +233202964065.
